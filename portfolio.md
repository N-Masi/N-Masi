## An Introduction to Quantum Computing
* Paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/133497IIniO4rrsxoizD9gzUPon1xj0h8/view?usp=drive_link
* Code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pjp4IYr9yRQqdHSF53U3fJIaZzqBvpro?usp=drive_link

This paper was my final project for APMA 1930W (Probabilities of Quantum Mechanics) where I explain the basics of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and Grover's quantum search algorithm. I include code that implements Grover's algorithm and that can be run on IBM's quantum computers.

## Binarized Neural Networks
* Tech Stack: TensorFlow, TFLite, Keras, Larq, Python, Google Colab
* Code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/134v2cLDpJmyAAC5no365x9ibZGZXgEDn?usp=sharing

This was an original final project for CS 1470 (Deep Learning) where I worked with [arvindsridhar1](https://github.com/arvindsridhar1) to design an experiment comparing the accuracy and memory usage of binarized neural networks (BNNs) versus their full-precision counterparts. This work was a reimplementation of a [paper by Courbariaux et al. (2016).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830) I wrote all of the code in the Colab notebook to carry out our experimental design. In doing so, I became better at best practices of using TensorFlow and Keras for creating neural networks. I used the TFLite Analyzer to compare serialized model file size to assess memory usage. I also deepened my understanding of BNNs (networks where all the weights and activations are either 1 or -1) by using the Larq library to implement them.

## TI-Nspire Program Repository
* Tech Stack: TI-Basic, HTML, GitHub Pages
* Website: https://n-masi.github.io/
* GitHub repo: https://github.com/N-Masi/N-Masi.github.io

This website hosts a repository of programs that I made for the TI-Nspire series of calculators back in high school. Programs are meant to help students extend the functionality of their calculators in the domains of statistics, geometry, and physics. The website contains instructions for getting the programs onto one's calculator. 100's of unique visitors.

* Tech Stack: Node, Express, HTML, Firebase
* Website: https://charcuterie-club.web.app/
* GitHub repo: https://github.com/N-Masi/charcuterie

Created the website for Brown University's official Charcuterie Club.

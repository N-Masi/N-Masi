# About Me

Hello! I'm an undergraduate at Brown University studying Computer Science + International and Public Affairs. My current interests lie in deep learning, leveraging LPWAN communication for personal use, and getting better at fullstack. I am most proficient in Python, Java, and React. Please find a portfolio of projects that I have worked on below.

# Projects on the Web
* Fantasy Twitter
* Candivote
* TI-Nspire Program Repository

## Fantasy Twitter
* Tech Stack: Firebase (Realtime Database & Hosting), React, Python, Heroku, Twitter API v2
* Link: https://fantasy-twitter.web.app
* GitHub repo: https://github.com/N-Masi/fantasy-twitter

Fantasy Twitter is Twitter turned into a fantasy sport. Users create accounts that are managed and kept secure with Firebase, and from there they can compete against other users in weekly matchups to have their teams get the most points. Teams are collections of Twitter accounts, where engagement on accounts' tweets that week (e.g., likes, replies, retweets) earns points. A Python script running on Heroku gets live data from the Twitter API every night to calculate scores and then updates a Firebase Realtime Database. Users can sign in to their accounts on the Firebase hosted website to check how their teams are doing; the React frontend displays data from the Realtime Database.

This project was first worked on as a group final project for CS 320 alongside four other developers (X, Y, Z, ZZ). After I originated and brought the project design to the group, we worked together to flesh it out using stakeholder feedback. Through this I learned how to work as a part of a team of developers using GitHub for version control, Trello for task assignment and division of labor, and agile practices where we worked in sprints and built functionality around user stories. My contributions to the project were: updating our database with info from Twitter API calls via a Python script, displaying the appropriate data on the frontend for the signed in user, refactoring React class components into functional components, and creating the game design and algorithms. Since the conclusion of the class I have continued to develop the website myself where I deployed the Python script to Heroku, improved the frontend UI, and fleshed out the backend to take it from a class project to functioning website.

## Candivote

## TI-Nspire Program Repository
* Tech Stack: TI-Basic, HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages
* Link: https://n-masi.github.io/
* GitHub repo: https://github.com/N-Masi/N-Masi.github.io

This website hosts a repository of programs I have made for the TI-Nspire series of calculators. Programs are meant to help students extend the functionality of their calculators in the domains of statistics, geometry, and physics. The webiste contains instructions for getting the programs onto one's calculator, and all the programs come packed with a detailed README explaining their specific use.
